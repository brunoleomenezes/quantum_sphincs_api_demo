# Project Content Manifest

\================================

**Project:** Quantum SPHINCS+ API Demo
**Description:** REST API for validating the resilience of the SPHINCS+ digital signature algorithm against simulated quantum attacks using Qiskit, integrating C and Python routines.

**Authors:**

* Bruno Leonardo Santos Menezes (lead author)
* Franklin de Lima Marquezino
* Claudio Miceli de Farias

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 2025

**Included directory structure:**

`/external`

* Official SPHINCS+ code (submodule linked to the original repository).
* Includes Makefile, C implementation, and headers for key generation, signing, and verification.

`/src/c_tests`

* Unit and integration tests developed in C using CMocka.
* Includes validation of key generation, signing, edge cases, and quantum resistance.

`/src/quantum_attacks`

* Python scripts using Qiskit.
* Includes simulations of quantum attacks with GHZ circuits, Groverâ€™s algorithm, and entanglement.

`/requirements.txt`

* Python dependencies for executing quantum attacks and the REST API.

`/Procfile`

* Configuration file for deployment and running the API in environments such as Railway and Heroku.

`/LICENSE`

* Academic Non-Commercial License.

`README.md`

* General project documentation with usage instructions.

`.gitignore` and `.gitmodules`

* Version control files (included to preserve repository integrity).

## **Notes:**

The included files and code are intended solely for scientific and educational demonstration of the robustness of the SPHINCS+ algorithm in simulated quantum attack scenarios.
